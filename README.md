# Form
This is a challenge proposed in lesson 01 of CoderHouse's React
course. We were meant to create a form with basic validation in order to revise HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript concepts. 

I used ES5 constructors instead of ES6 classes just to practice doing it this way. 

# How to test it
    1. Clone this project locally 
    2. Open index.html using any browser of your preference 
    3. Have fun playing with different values.

Any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome! 

Ps: I will be upgrading this form :)
