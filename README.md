# Form
This is a challenge proposed in lesson 01 of CoderHouse's React
course. We were meant to create a form with basic validation in order to revise HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript concepts. 

I used ES5 constructors instead of ES6 classes just to practice doing it this way. 

Any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome! 

Ps: I will be upgrading this form :)
